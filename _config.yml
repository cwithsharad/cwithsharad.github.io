tagline: A site dedicated to C.S.
description: "A site dedicated to C.S. and Technnology. Made by <a href="https://www.sharad.cf" Launched in 2017 for helping the students in finding all the codes on a single site. The thought of launching this came from the idea that most of the sites or the blogs available are not that much oriented towards a particular course moreover there are hardly few blogs of websites which are available for the B.C.A."
